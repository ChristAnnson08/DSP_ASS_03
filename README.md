# Collaborative Development of the CSV Explorer Web Application

## Contributors

## Overview
The CSV Explorer Web Application is a Python-powered tool that allows users to interactively analyze CSV files. With functionalities tailored for exploring data frames, analyzing numerical data, examining text data, and interpreting datetime data, this application provides a streamlined interface for data analysis.

Throughout development, the team encountered several challenges related to GitHub usage, stemming primarily from differences in team members’ experience levels. To tackle these issues, regular Zoom meetings were held to help members set up a standardized coding environment, troubleshoot merge conflicts, and establish a workflow. Given the private nature of the GitHub repository and limitations of free accounts, the team implemented strict code review protocols to ensure smooth collaboration and maintain code quality.

Handling diverse data types—like numeric, text, and datetime—within the application demanded specific processing methods and visualization techniques. The team faced the challenge of creating an intuitive user interface that balances simplicity with a rich feature set. This required careful attention to design to make the app user-friendly and accessible. Additionally, the need to optimize performance for larger datasets was addressed through techniques such as lazy loading, efficient data handling, and algorithmic optimizations, which significantly improved the user experience. The project necessitated a blend of technical expertise, user-centered design, and performance tuning.

Potential enhancements for the CSV Explorer Web App could include more advanced data visualization capabilities, interactive filtering options, customizable dashboards, and integration with external data sources for expanded functionality. These features would enrich the user experience, support deeper data exploration, and potentially enable collaborative data analysis. Ensuring that the application is responsive across various screen sizes and device types is another priority for future updates, improving accessibility for all users.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project_directory>`
3. Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - For macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install all required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Application

1. Confirm that Python is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt, and navigate to the project directory.
3. Start the Streamlit application by running: `streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py`
4. The app will open in a browser window. From there, you can upload a CSV file and explore its features, including detailed data analysis for numerical, text, and datetime columns.
